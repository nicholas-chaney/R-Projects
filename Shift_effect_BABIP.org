* Question?
  What effect does the deffensive shift in baseball have on a hitter's
  number of hits and BABIP (The average of number of times a player
  gets a hit on balls put into play).

* What is a defensive shift in baseball?
  A defensive shift is moving defensive players out of their standard
  positioning to an area of the field that the batter is more likely
  to hit the ball. Example of standard positioning vs shifted
  positioning below.

* Spraychart of Andrew McCutchen shift vs. no shift
In the spray chart below you can see every ball that Andrew McCutchen
put into play where the field was shifted compared to when they field
was standard.

#+RESULTS:

The graph above is hard to tell a percentage of shift so I created
a pie chart to see this better. As you can see the defense was shifted
more often than not, out of about 400 attempts.

 #+RESULTS:
 
* BABIP based on shift
 The shift reduced the BABIP(Batting Average on Balls In Play) as is
 shown below. With the shift the average BABIP was .316 and whithout
 the shift it was .329. Using these percentages we can assume this
 trend would continue and we canalso determine
 that if the shift was used for all balls put in play there would have
 been 118,638*.316 = 37,489 hits. Doing the same thing for standard
 there would have been 39,031 hits. This shows that the number of hits
 would be reduced by roughly 1500 hits.

#+RESULTS:

* Conclusion
 After doing this research I found that using the shift reduces BABIP
 from .329 down to .316. It also reduced hits by around 1,500 total
 hits.
